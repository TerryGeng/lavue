feature requests:
 - take/store (and apply) dark image
 - limit setting with displayed histogram

maintenance:
 - make settings display easier

code maintainability:
- make source abstract to allow for other inputs
-> dockable source widget??


Issues:
 - getting data from hidra is not optimal
 - status of hidra objects is not accessible: query initiated? transfer object valid?
 - image scaling is present due to non-existing mapping to screen resolution
 - image is rotated by 90 degrees, but unclear where => is pyqtgraph the culprit?
