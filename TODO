Issues:
    !! image downsampling when array size larger than monitor display size

    !! log scale expensive for large detector images
        ---> possible solution: lut

- show unscaled image!

- try: colorbar/schemes: white/black, b/w , rainbow

- update happens only at next image (signalling takes longer than update...?)

- fix wrong upper limit of double spinbox

- fix wrong label in image statistics
